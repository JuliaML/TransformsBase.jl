This package is intended for developers of data transforms such as
the maintainers of [TableTransforms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/TableTransforms.jl).
It defines a simple API and basic transforms that work with any type of object such as
the `Identity` and `Sequential` transforms. Check dependant packages for more information.
