[![][build-img]][build-url] [![][codecov-img]][codecov-url]

This package is intended for developers of data transforms such as
the maintainers of [TableTransforms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/TableTransforms.jl).
It defines a simple API and basic transforms that work with any type of object such as
the `Identity` and `Sequential` transforms.
